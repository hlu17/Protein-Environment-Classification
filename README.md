# Protein Environment Classification
## By Sophie Yeh, Ed Kirton, Delaney Scheiern, and Haibi Lu

This project explores various modeling methods for classifying samples into environments. For each sample, we have data on the proportions of proteins found within it. Some of these proteins have known functions, but others are unknown. Our goal is to be able to create a classifier for these samples, but also to analyze the feature importance within our models. Understanding how certain proteins impact our classification decisions can lead scientists to research and discover unknown protein functions.

The Jupyter Notebook `main.ipynb` will walk you through our entire modeling process, from data structuring to feature importance analysis. The other files are supplementary, and will be referenced in the `main.ipynb` file when necessary.
